# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects (MIUUL)

This repository includes various data science and machine learning projects that I developed as part of my training at MIUUL Data Science Bootcamp.

## Projects

- **Customer Segmentation:**  
  Applied clustering algorithms to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.

- **Churn Prediction:**  
  Built a classification model to predict customer churn using logistic regression and decision trees.

- **Feature Engineering Practice:**  
  Focused on data preprocessing and feature generation to improve model performance.

- **Data Analysis with Pandas:**  
  Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on different datasets using Pandas and visualization libraries.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature selection and engineering
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Data visualization and interpretation

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
